- Jayla Taylor as connected seller (acct_1DI4ATKrJePIAxsA)
- Destination charges for automatic fee splitting
- Webhook handler for both /webhoks and /webhooks endpoints
- Rotated API keys for security

#### ✅ **Serverless Architecture**
- Created `api/index.js` serverless entry point
- Integrated all security middleware
- Environment variable validation
- Enhanced logging for production debugging
- Proper routing for static files and API endpoints

### 🔐 **Current Status: Deployment Protection Enabled**

The deployment is **successful and running**, but access is restricted by Vercel's deployment protection feature.

**This is normal for organization/team accounts and indicates the deployment is secure.**

## 🎯 **Final Steps to Complete:**

### Step 1: Disable Deployment Protection (Recommended)
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project: **jaylataylor-fashion**
3. Go to **Settings** → **Deployment Protection**
4. Disable protection OR add bypass rules for production domain

### Step 2: Configure Custom Domain (Alternative)
If you have `jaylataylor.com` configured as a custom domain:
1. The production domain should bypass protection automatically
2. Test: `https://jaylataylor.com/health` (should work without authentication)

### Step 3: Environment Variables Verification
All required variables should be set in Vercel Dashboard:

```env
✅ STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = [rotated key]
✅ STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY = pk_live_51Rj8...
✅ STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET = whsec_dOLRDHjwOQFbjJR7dXpZNKmYE8p20EoM
✅ JAYLA_STRIPE_ACCOUNT_ID = acct_1DI4ATKrJePIAxsA
✅ PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE = 10
✅ JWT_SECRET = 22452869ddb175de0b71854a0e7700e9d93f9429b4cf166784534319d4a0b9e96ca6af2d2008f02338ffbb0188f38544bc9e3361b4511c7678852779628b2059
```

## 🧪 **Testing Plan After Protection Removal:**

### Health Check Tests:
```bash
# API health endpoint
curl https://jaylataylor.com/health

# Expected response:
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-19T...",
  "environment": "production",
  "serverless": true,
  "security": {
    "stripe-connect": true,
    "webhook-secret": true,
    "jwt-auth": true,
    "jayla-account": true
  }
}
```

### Payment Integration Tests:
1. **Frontend**: Visit https://jaylataylor.com
2. **Shopping Cart**: Add items and proceed to checkout
3. **Test Payment**: Use Stripe test card `4242 4242 4242 4242`
4. **Webhook Verification**: Check Stripe Dashboard for events
5. **Platform Fee**: Verify 10% fee is applied and transferred

### Security Feature Tests:
1. **Rate Limiting**: Multiple rapid requests should be throttled
2. **CSRF Protection**: State-changing requests require valid tokens
3. **JWT Authentication**: Protected endpoints require valid sessions
4. **Input Sanitization**: XSS attempts should be blocked
