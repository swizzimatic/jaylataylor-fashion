# ðŸš¨ URGENT: SECURITY ACTION REQUIRED

## CRITICAL: Production Stripe Keys Were Exposed

### What Happened
Production Stripe keys were found in `.env.supabase.local`:
- **Secret Key**: `sk_live_51Rj8Zj2M...` (partial shown for identification)
- **Webhook Secret**: `whsec_dOLRDHjw...` (partial shown for identification)
- **Publishable Key**: `pk_live_51Rj8Zj2M...` (partial shown for identification)

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

## Step 1: Rotate Keys NOW (5 minutes)
1. Open [Stripe Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys)
2. Click "Roll key" for the Secret Key
3. Click "Roll endpoint secret" in Webhooks section
4. Save new keys securely (password manager)

## Step 2: Update Vercel (5 minutes)
1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select `jaylataylor-website` project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Update these variables with NEW keys:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

## Step 3: Redeploy (2 minutes)
```bash
vercel --prod --yes
```

## Step 4: Update Frontend (2 minutes)
Update the publishable key in your frontend files:
- `jaylataylor-website/js/checkout.js`
- Any other files using Stripe

## What We've Done to Secure Your Project

### âœ… Completed Actions:
1. **Deleted** `.env.supabase.local` containing exposed keys
2. **Verified** `.gitignore` properly excludes env files
3. **Created** `.env.template` for safe local development
4. **Created** `VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md` documentation
5. **Keys were never committed** to git (already in .gitignore)

### ðŸ“‹ Your Action Items:
- [ ] **RIGHT NOW**: Rotate Stripe keys in Dashboard
- [ ] **NEXT**: Update Vercel environment variables
- [ ] **THEN**: Redeploy with `vercel --prod --yes`
- [ ] **FINALLY**: Monitor Stripe for unauthorized activity

## Timeline Impact

Since the keys were in `.env.supabase.local` which was gitignored:
- **Good news**: Keys were NOT pushed to GitHub
- **Risk**: Local file exposure only
- **Action**: Still rotate keys as best practice

## Prevention for Future

1. **Never create .env files with production keys locally**
2. **Always use Vercel Dashboard for production secrets**
3. **Use only TEST keys for local development**
4. **Regular key rotation every 90 days**
