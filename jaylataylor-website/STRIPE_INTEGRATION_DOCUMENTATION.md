## Overview

The Jayla Taylor website uses a modern e-commerce architecture with Stripe integration for secure payment processing. The system consists of:

- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JS website with shopping cart functionality
- **Backend**: Express.js server handling payment processing and validation
- **Payment Processor**: Stripe for secure card processing and compliance

### Key Features
- Secure payment processing with Stripe
- Server-side price validation to prevent tampering
- Collection-based purchase restrictions (Timeless collection is display-only)
- Real-time webhook handling for payment confirmations
- Mobile-responsive checkout experience

---

## Stripe Integration Setup

### Environment Configuration

**Required Environment Variables (.env file in backend folder):**
```env
# Stripe Configuration
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_actual_stripe_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your_actual_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_your_webhook_endpoint_secret

# Server Configuration
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourwebsite.com
```

**CRITICAL:** Replace test keys with live keys for production:
- Test keys start with `sk_test_` and `pk_test_`
- Live keys start with `sk_live_` and `pk_live_`

### Stripe Dashboard Configuration

1. **Login to Stripe Dashboard**: https://dashboard.stripe.com
2. **Navigate to Developers > Webhooks**
3. **Add endpoint**: `https://yourbackend.com/api/webhook`
4. **Select events to listen for**:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `charge.succeeded`
   - `payment_method.attached`

### Frontend Configuration

Update the Stripe publishable key in `/js/checkout.js`:
```javascript
// Line 6 in checkout.js
const stripe = Stripe('pk_live_your_actual_publishable_key');
```

---

## Payment Flow Documentation

### 1. Customer Journey
1. **Browse Products**: Customer views products on shop.html
2. **Add to Cart**: Items stored in local storage with backend validation
3. **Checkout**: Customer enters shipping/billing information
4. **Payment**: Stripe securely processes card information
5. **Confirmation**: Webhook confirms payment and completes order

### 2. Technical Flow
```
Frontend Cart → Backend Validation → Stripe Payment Intent → Card Processing → Webhook Confirmation
```

### 3. Collection Restrictions
- **Purchasable Collections**: Bucket Hats, Swim Collection, Lingerie Collection
- **Display Only**: Timeless Collection (marked with `notForSale: true`)

**Server-side validation ensures customers cannot purchase restricted items.**

### 4. Price Validation System
- All prices validated server-side against `products.json`
- Frontend cannot manipulate final prices
- Webhook verification ensures payment integrity
