## üéØ How It Works

When a customer buys from Jayla:

1. **Customer pays** ‚Üí Goes to YOUR platform account first
2. **Platform takes 10%** ‚Üí Automatically deducted ($10 from $100 sale)
3. **Jayla gets 90%** ‚Üí Automatically transferred ($90 from $100 sale)
4. **Daily/Weekly payout** ‚Üí Jayla receives money in her bank

## üì± Dashboard Access

Jayla can access her earnings dashboard at:
```
http://yourdomain.com/seller-dashboard.html
```

Features:
- View balance (available & pending)
- See recent transfers
- Track payouts to bank
- Access Stripe Express Dashboard

## üö® Important Notes

### Security
- **NEVER** commit `.env` to Git
- **NEVER** expose Jayla's account ID publicly
- **ALWAYS** verify webhook signatures

### Testing
- Use test keys first (`sk_test_`, `pk_test_`)
- Test with Stripe test cards: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Verify platform fee calculation
- Check transfers appear in Jayla's account

### Production Checklist

- [ ] Update webhook endpoints to production URL
- [ ] Enable HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Test complete payment flow
- [ ] Verify Jayla can access her dashboard
